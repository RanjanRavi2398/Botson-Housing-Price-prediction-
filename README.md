# Botson-Housing-Price-prediction-
In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Bostonâ€™s suburbs. The list of tasks below : 
1) Exploratory Analysis using ggplot2 
2) Splitting the dataset into Train and Test (7:3 Combinations) 
3) Predict the accuracy of Random forest, Linear Regression and XGBoost classification model. 
4) Compare the multiple models using RMSE
